# Swift and JavaScript Data Exchange

This project demonstrates how to exchange data between Swift and JavaScript using WKWebView. The project includes a simple example where a Swift app sends data to JavaScript and vice versa.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Create a new iOS app and add a `WKWebView` to your app's main view controller.
4. Replace the content of your main view controller's Swift file with the content of the `ViewController.swift` file provided in this repository.
5. Add the `index.html` file to your app's bundle.
6. Build and run the app on an iOS simulator or device.
7. Interact with the app to see data exchange between Swift and JavaScript in action.

## Files

- `ViewController.swift`: Contains the Swift code for setting up a WKWebView, loading the HTML file, and handling data exchange with JavaScript.
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML and JavaScript code for sending and receiving data to/from Swift.
